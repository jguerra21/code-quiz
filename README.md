# code-quiz
With this code quiz homework assigment i have used JavaScript and bootstrap for style. I did not include any additional style with my style.css file.
I have all the functions working and the timer is giving a total time and i made a function to substract time if the game answer is incorrect. I try including a screenshot to my READ.ME file here but my path was not working so i have included the screenshot under images.

Here i have used all the steps that were given to us in class to achieve all the functions of the game.
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button and inside the button create a timer that will give me a time limit
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

I try to add the screenshot under here but my image path was not working! The screenshot image is located under Image files.
